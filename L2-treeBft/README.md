# Breadth First Traversal on a Tree

Write a function called `treeBft()` that takes in the root node of a tree and returns an
array of values of the nodes in that tree. The nodes should be in breadth-first order.

```
let tree1 = ...
             4
          /     \
        2         6
      /   \     /   \
     1     3   5     7
```

The expected value of `treeBft(tree1)` would be `[4, 2, 6, 1, 3, 5, 7]`.
