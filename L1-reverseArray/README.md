# Reverse an Array

Write a function called reverseArray. This should take in an
array and reverse it IN PLACE (i.e. modify the input, return nothing)

## Examples:
* `reverseArray([1, 2, 3]) --> input becomes [3, 2, 1]`
* `console.log([1, 2, 3]) --> undefined`

Your solution must run in **O(n)** (linear) time and consume **O(1)** (constant) space.

Because this is a logical exercise, you may not use `Array.reverse()` in
your solution.
