# List all subsets of a set

Given a list of items, create a list of all possible subsets of that list.

Write a function called `listAllSubsets(arr)` that takes in an array of strings.
Return an array of arrays of strings where each nested array is a different
combination of items.

## Example:
```
listAllSubsets(["A", "B", "C"]) --> [
  [],
  ["A"],
  ["B"],
  ["C"],
  ["A", "B"],
  ["A", "C"],
  ["B", "C"],
  ["A", "B", "C"]
]
```

The order of the output does not matter.
