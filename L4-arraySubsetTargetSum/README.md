# Does a subset exist that equals a given sum?

Suppose you're given an array of integers and a target sum.

Can you find whether or not it is possible to find a subset of those integers
whose sum is equal to that target value?

## For example:
* `hasSubsetSum([1, 3, 10, 14], 18) --> true`, because `1 + 3 + 14 = 18`
* `hasSubsetSum([2, 4, 6, 8], 7) --> false`, because you can't add any combination of these numbers to get `7`.
